# Earth Quake Sorter
A program that analyzes and sorts live earthquake data reported at http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.atom

The program allows the user to sort the data by things like magnitude, distance from a certain location, title, etc.


## Motivation
This mini project was built when I just started learning java. My motivation was to learn more about parsing and working
with live xml data, and to learn how to use the comparator interface.

## Built With
IntelliJ IDEA

## How to use
Run the main method in src.ui.main
